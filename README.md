# C++ Program for MATLAB Interaction

This C++ program is designed to interact with MATLAB. When run, it will ask for a file name, generate an output, and provide a file that can be processed by MATLAB.

## Folder Structure

Ensure the following folder structure for your project:

project/ 
├── main.cpp # C++ source code for the main program 
├── funzioni/ # Folder containing function files (e.g., Runge_Kutta.cpp, mat_vet.cpp) │ ├── Runge_Kutta.cpp │ ├── mat_vet.cpp │ ├── mat_vet.h 
├── README.md # This README file


### Important Notes:
- The `funzioni` folder must be at the same level** as `main.cpp`. If the directory structure is different, you'll need to adjust the `#include` directives in your C++ source files accordingly.

## Compiling the Program

### Requirements:
- C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`, `clang++`)
- MATLAB (to process the results after the program generates the file)

### Steps to Compile:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where `main.cpp` is located.
   
2. Use the following command to compile the C++ program:

   g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp funzioni/*.cpp -o program
This command compiles the program and generates an executable named program; once compiled, you can run the program with the following command:
./program
The program will prompt you to input a file name (maximum 20 characters),ask you a number of steps and then write the number of steps and evaluations.
The program will generate output based on your input and save it to the specified file.
Example:
After running the program, you'll see a prompt like this:
Enter the name of the output file (max 20 characters): results.txt
ou can then provide the name (e.g., results.txt), and the program will write the generated results to that file.

MATLAB Integration
Once the output file is created, you can process it in MATLAB as follows:

Open MATLAB.
Ensure that MATLAB can access the generated output file (for example, if it's in the same directory, simply reference it by name).
Example MATLAB Code:
In MATLAB, you can load and process the results like this:
% Load the data from the file
k = load('results.txt');
The exact MATLAB code will depend on the format of the output generated by your C++ program. Be sure to adapt it based on your needs.

Troubleshooting
Compilation Issues: If you face compilation issues, double-check the file paths for your #include directives. Ensure the C++ compiler is installed correctly.

File Path Issues: If the program cannot locate the funzioni directory, ensure it is in the correct location (same level as main.cpp) or update the #include paths in the code accordingly.
